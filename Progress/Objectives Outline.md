**_(all camps include easy and medium projects, no hard ones due to resources and difficulty)_**

* ## HALF-DAY CAMP!
  * (easy) Block Thrower
  * (e)Line Tracer
    -If finished early, (Medium) All About Walkbots
 * ### ^^ Half Day write-up:
  * #### What went well
    * The kids get very involved in the robot building and testing
    * Coding seems to interest a good majority
    * Got questions about designing their own robot (could be looked into for a longer camp)
  * #### What needs to be worked on
    * Projects need to be tested in more depth
    * More time for looking at calibration and continued testing
    * Sorted kits would have been super helpful (but requires a lot of time)
    * Possibly an added project
    * A set bracket system for competitions
    * More talk about sensors and motors in a way that sparks interest (I felt like most of my explanations bored them or wasn't reaching them)
